# Youtube-Trending-Video-Analysis
YouTube Trending Video Analysis with Pandas and Seaborn.
In this project, I've done data cleaning and manipulation on a dataset that contains trending
video statistics in the US and then analyzed and visualized the data and got some good and useful results.

You will have to install pandas and seaborn first and unzip the USVideos file also.
The main focus on this project is to practice data analysis and visualization with Pandas and Seaborn.
There is, of course, much more we can do on this dataset.
Thank You for Reading....
